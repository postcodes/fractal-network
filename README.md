# FractalNet

FractalNet is a decentralized professional identity and reputation system that revolutionizes how professional credentials are verified and shared. The platform uses zero-knowledge proofs and fractal mathematics to create verifiable professional credentials while keeping sensitive personal data completely private and self-sovereign.

The system leverages zk-SNARKs to enable professionals to prove qualifications, work experience, and skill endorsements without revealing actual details or personal information. Smart contracts automate verification challenges where users can stake tokens on their credentials' authenticity, creating economic incentives for honest behavior through slashing mechanisms that penalize false claims. The innovative fractal reputation algorithm analyzes geometric patterns of professional relationships to calculate trust scores that become increasingly accurate and tamper-resistant as the network expands.

FractalNet enables professionals to maintain complete privacy sovereignty while selectively revealing verified attributes for job applications, client proposals, and partnership opportunities without centralized gatekeepers. The platform integrates seamlessly with existing professional platforms through APIs, allowing users to prove they worked at prestigious companies or possess specific skills without disclosing exact details. This creates a trustless professional ecosystem where credentials retain relevance through time-decay functions and peer validation mechanisms.
